v2.0 by PatPeter
- 2011-12-24 19:30 - Commented out bloated onEnable(), onDisable(), and usage() body.

- 2011-12-24 19:30 - Replaced usage() body with a single-line message.

- 2011-12-31 18:30 - Added more lines to usage without repetition.
- 2011-12-31 18:40 - Moved gm.admin test outside the for loop - no need to have it loop and then test twice if the player cannot change the game mode of another.
- 2011-12-31 19:15 - Re-added ability to use 0 and 1 for survival and creative, respectively.
- 2011-12-31 19:35 - Fixed several typos, i.e. "Insufficent" and "isent".

- 2011-12-31 20:00 - Offloaded algorithm inefficiency to memory in for loop.
